This is a drawing pad that is used to draw easy shapes like circle and straight line in a console using ascii characters. 
This is just the first version made as of now, I will improvise on this in near future.

drawPad.h contains the header file that allows you to make drawings.
clock.cpp contains an example usage of drawPad.h header file to make a simple animation of a clock that shows seconds from 1 to 60
