This is a drawing pad that is used to draw easy shapes like circle and straight line in a console using ascii characters. 
This is just the first version made as of now, I will improvise on this in near future.

the functions and their uses are mentioned in the header file's commentation

<b>drawPad.h</b> contains the header file that allows you to make drawings.<br>
<b>clock.cpp</b> contains an example usage of drawPad.h header file to make a simple animation of a clock that shows seconds from 1 to 60
